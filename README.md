# A Multi-Model AI Framework for Classification and Support of Learning Disabilities

> A child-friendly, accessible multi-model AI platform for handwriting-based screening and adaptive cognitive learning support — built with Streamlit and PyTorch.

---

## Overview

This graduation project combines **deep learning classification** of handwritten samples with an interactive **learning support layer** of cognitive games. Children practice through playful, dyslexia-aware UI; teachers and parents monitor progress through a secure dashboard with charts, history, and CSV export.

The system is designed around two principles:

1. **Child safety** — No diagnostic labels are shown to children; feedback stays encouraging and age-appropriate.
2. **Accessibility first** — OpenDyslexic font, high contrast, large touch targets, light/dark themes, and clear instructional text throughout.

## Features

### Two Operating Modes

| Mode | Audience | Capabilities |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Child Mode** | Children (ages 4–18) | Handwriting upload, cognitive games, star rewards, anonymous or named profiles |
| **Teacher / Parent Mode** | Educators & caregivers | Secure login, per-child analytics, session history, rename/delete accounts, CSV export |

### Core Modules

#### Handwriting Classification (Tabs 1–2)

- Upload handwriting images (camera, file, or drag-and-drop)
- Run inference with **CNN**, **MobileNet V3 Large**, or **EfficientNet-B0**
- View child-safe results on the Classification Result page
- Optional teacher-facing confidence and model comparison details
- Results persisted to SQLite for longitudinal tracking

#### Learning Support Hub (Tab 3)

Central practice hub showing stars earned, recent activity, and quick links to all games.

#### Cognitive Support Games (Tabs 4–8)

| Tab | Module | What it measures |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| **4** | Attention & Focus | Age-based focus duration, countdown timer, target-letter search |
| **5** | Visual Memory | Grid recall with configurable display time and difficulty levels |
| **6** | Auditory Memory | Listen-and-repeat tone sequences (phonological loop) |
| **7** | Working Memory | Forward / backward digit span trials |
| **8** | Processing Speed | Same/different, color matching, and pattern recognition under time pressure |

#### Final Assessment (Tab 9)

A composite **Final Challenge** that walks through six mini-tasks (attention, visual memory, auditory memory, word memory, working memory, processing speed) and produces a 0–100 cognitive profile saved to the database.

#### Teacher Dashboard

- Child profile (name, ID, age, last activity)
- Rename anonymous `Friend-XXXX` placeholder accounts
- Overview progress chart across all activities (Plotly)
- Per-module session history with trend lines and raw data tables
- Delete individual sessions or entire child records
- Export all progress to CSV

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (3.10+ recommended)
- **pip** and a virtual environment tool (`venv`, `conda`, etc.)
- **~2 GB disk space** for PyTorch and model weights
- **Optional:** CUDA-capable GPU for faster inference (CPU works fine)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone or download the project

```bash
cd "Grad project"
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install plotly
```

> Plotly is used by the teacher dashboard charts. Install it explicitly if charts fail to render.

### 4. Add model weights

Place trained checkpoints in the `models/` folder:

| Model | Required filename |
|-------|-------------------|
| Custom CNN | `cnn_classifier (2).pth` |
| MobileNet V3 Large | `mobilenet_v3_large_classifier.pth` |
| EfficientNet-B0 | `efficientnet_b0_classifier (1).pth` |

See [`weights/README.md`](weights/README.md) for checkpoint format details and troubleshooting.

> **Without weights:** Models initialize with random parameters so the UI and workflow still run for demonstration — predictions will not be meaningful until real checkpoints are added.

---

## Configuration

### Teacher / Parent credentials

Copy the example secrets file and customize:

```bash
cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

```toml
ADMIN_USERNAME = "admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "YourSecurePassword"
```

Default demo credentials (used when no secrets file exists):

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Username | `admin` |
| Password | `Teacher@123` |

> Change these before any production or shared deployment.

---

## Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens at **http://localhost:8501**.

### Quick start walkthrough

1. **Choose Child Mode** → create a profile or tap *Skip — just play!*
2. **Check My Writing** → upload a handwriting sample → view results
3. **My games** → try Focus, Memory, or Quick Think modules
4. **Switch to Teacher Mode** → log in → select a child → review charts and export CSV

---

## Testing & Verification

### Run the test suite

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

| Test file | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| `test_auth_logic.py` | Teacher credential verification |
| `test_database.py` | SQLite CRUD and progress queries |
| `test_image_processing.py` | Preprocessing pipeline |
| `test_model_loader.py` | Model loading and inference |
| `test_scoring.py` | Game scoring logic |

### Pre-flight smoke check

Validates database round-trips, image processing, auth, and weight availability:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_check.py
```

Exit code `0` = all critical checks passed.

---

## Kaggle Datasets

Model training in `Notebooks/` relies on **two Kaggle datasets** mounted under `/kaggle/input/`. The Streamlit app itself does not download these — they are only needed when re-running the training notebooks.

### 1. Dyslexia Handwriting Dataset

| | |
|---|---|
| **Kaggle** | [drizasazanitaisa/dyslexia-handwriting-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drizasazanitaisa/dyslexia-handwriting-dataset) |
| **Mount path** | `/kaggle/input/dyslexia-dataset` |
| **Format** | Folder-per-class image files (`ImageFolder`) |

Handwritten letter images grouped into three source folders. The dataset combines uppercase letters from NIST Special Database 19, lowercase samples from public handwriting collections, and real-world writing from dyslexic students (Penang, Malaysia) — as described in related dyslexia-handwriting research.

```
dyslexia-dataset/
├── Train/
│   ├── Normal/      # Standard letter orientation (non-dyslexic baseline)
│   ├── Reversal/    # Mirrored / flipped letters (dyslexia-related reversals)
│   └── Corrected/   # Reversed letters corrected back (residual reversal cues)
└── Test/
    ├── Normal/
    ├── Reversal/
    └── Corrected/
```

**Approximate size** (from `Final code.ipynb` exploration):

| Split | Samples |
|-------|---------|
| Train | ~151,649 |
| Test | ~56,723 |
| **Total** | **~208,372** |

**Binary label mapping** used during training (`remap_synthetic_to_binary`):

| Folder | Binary label | Meaning |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `Normal` | **0 — Normal** | Non-dyslexic handwriting |
| `Reversal` | **1 — Dyslexia** | Dyslexia-indicator patterns |
| `Corrected` | **1 — Dyslexia** | Corrected forms that still carry reversal cues |

The custom **CNN** checkpoint keeps the original three folders as separate output classes internally; **MobileNet** and **EfficientNet** train on the collapsed binary labels above.

---

### 2. EMNIST ByClass

| | |
|---|---|
| **Kaggle** | [crawford/emnist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist) |
| **Mount path** | `/kaggle/input/emnist` |
| **Files used** | `emnist-byclass-train.csv`, `emnist-byclass-test.csv` |
| **Format** | CSV — column 0 = class label, columns 1–784 = 28×28 pixel values |

[EMNIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset) (Extended MNIST) **ByClass** split: 62 classes covering digits, uppercase, and lowercase letters.

| Split | Samples |
|-------|---------|
| Train | ~697,932 |
| Test | ~116,323 |

**Role in this project:** EMNIST acts as **normal-handwriting augmentation**. All 62 classes are remapped to binary label **0 (Normal)** so the model sees a large volume of standard character shapes alongside dyslexia-indicator samples.

---

### How the datasets are combined

The training notebooks merge both sources before the train/validation/test split:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Dyslexia Handwriting   │     │   EMNIST ByClass        │
│  Normal / Reversal /    │     │   62 classes → all      │
│  Corrected → binary     │     │   mapped to Normal (0)  │
└───────────┬─────────────┘     └───────────┬─────────────┘
            │                               │
            └───────────┬───────────────────┘
                        ▼
              ConcatDataset (train / val / test)
                        │
            ┌───────────┼───────────┐
            ▼           ▼           ▼
         Training    Validation     Test
         (~subset)   (~subset)   (synthetic test + EMNIST test)
```

Configurable fractions (environment variables in the notebooks):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `EFFNET_DATASET_FRACTION` | `0.35` | Fraction of the dyslexia dataset used for training |
| `EMNIST_TRAIN_FRACTION` | `0.25` | Fraction of EMNIST train CSV used |

Train and validation sets combine **dyslexia samples + an EMNIST subset**. The test set pairs the held-out dyslexia test split with the full EMNIST test CSV for evaluation at scale.

---

### Adding datasets on Kaggle

When creating a Kaggle notebook session:

1. **Add Data** → search and attach both datasets above.
2. Confirm they appear as `dyslexia-dataset` and `emnist` under `/kaggle/input/` (Kaggle uses the dataset slug as the folder name).
3. Enable a **GPU** accelerator for training cells.
4. Run the notebook from top to bottom (or resume from saved checkpoints in `/kaggle/working/`).

**Kaggle CLI** (optional, with API credentials configured):

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d drizasazanitaisa/dyslexia-handwriting-dataset
kaggle datasets download -d crawford/emnist
```

Extract the archives and mirror the same folder layout locally, then update paths in the notebook from `/kaggle/input/…` to your local directories.

---

## Training Notebooks

The `Notebooks/` folder holds the **offline training phase** of the architecture — everything that produces the `.pth` checkpoints loaded by `models/model_loader.py` at runtime. These notebooks are **not** required to run the Streamlit app; they document how the models were built and can be re-run on Kaggle or a local GPU machine.

Dataset details and Kaggle setup are in [Kaggle Datasets](#kaggle-datasets).

### Primary notebook

| Notebook | Role |
|----------|------|
| **`Final code.ipynb`** | Canonical end-to-end pipeline. Loads the synthetic handwriting dataset (Normal, Reversed, Corrected folders), combines it with a subset of EMNIST, trains all three architectures, supports checkpoint resume, and evaluates on a held-out test set. **Start here** if you need to reproduce weights or understand label mapping. |

### Kaggle training runs

These are earlier or alternate Kaggle GPU sessions of the same dyslexia-detection pipeline. They overlap with `Final code.ipynb` but may differ in dataset fractions, checkpoint paths, or which models were trained in a given run.

| Notebook | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `notebookb85375af61.ipynb` | Trains **CNN** and **EfficientNet-B0**; includes checkpoint resume and balanced test-set evaluation. |
| `notebook2f6f077763 (6).ipynb` | Same pipeline family; alternate Kaggle execution with its own model-instance checkpoint. |

Duplicate copies of these notebooks also live under `Notebooks/Other/` for archival reference.

### What the training pipeline does

1. **Data** — Synthetic dyslexia handwriting samples (normal, reversed, corrected letter forms) plus EMNIST augmentation; train/val/test splits with reproducible seed.
2. **Preprocessing** — Model-specific transforms: 28×28 grayscale for the custom CNN; 224×224 padded grayscale for EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNet V3 Large.
3. **Training** — Fine-tunes three architectures with checkpoint saving so long Kaggle runs can resume after interruption.
4. **Evaluation** — Confusion matrices, classification reports, and metric logging on a balanced test set containing both dyslexic and non-dyslexic samples.
5. **Export** — Saved state dicts are copied into `models/` under the filenames listed in [Installation](#4-add-model-weights).

### Running a notebook

- **Kaggle:** Attach the datasets listed in [Kaggle Datasets](#kaggle-datasets), enable GPU, and run all cells.
- **Local:** Install the same PyTorch/torchvision stack as `requirements.txt`, point dataset paths at your local copies of the training folders, and adjust checkpoint directories away from `/kaggle/working/…`.

After training, align exported checkpoints with the names expected by `model_loader.py` (see [Machine Learning Models](#machine-learning-models) for class-label conventions).

---

## Machine Learning Models

Three architectures classify handwriting as **Non-Dyslexic** vs **Dyslexic** (binary display; CNN internally uses a 3-class head mapped to binary):

| Model | Input | Size | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| **Custom CNN** | Grayscale | 28×28 | 3-class checkpoint → binary via class aggregation |
| **MobileNet V3 Large** | Grayscale (padded) | 224×224 | Transfer learning with custom classifier head |
| **EfficientNet-B0** | Grayscale (padded) | 224×224 | Transfer learning with custom classifier head |

Training is documented in [Training Notebooks](#training-notebooks). Label mapping and checkpoint conventions for inference are in `models/model_loader.py`.

### Inference pipeline

```
Upload → EXIF correction → Grayscale → Resize / pad → Normalize → Model → Softmax → Child-safe label
```

---

## Database & Analytics

- **Engine:** SQLite (`database/learning_support.db`)
- **Persistence:** Data survives app restarts; tables use `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS` only (no destructive startup)
- **Entities:** parents, users (children), classification results, per-module session results, stars, final assessments
- **Export:** Teacher dashboard → *Export All Progress to CSV*

Key API surface: `database/db_handler.py` → `DatabaseHandler`

---

## Accessibility & UX

- **OpenDyslexic** font with increased letter-spacing and line-height
- **High-contrast** instructional text (black on white in light mode)
- **Large buttons** and touch-friendly game layouts
- **Light / dark theme** toggle on every page (sidebar)
- **Star reward system** for positive reinforcement
- **Anonymous play** — children can start without typing a name; teachers rename later
- **No diagnostic jargon** shown to children
