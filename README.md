# Learning Disabilities AI Framework

A child-friendly, accessible Streamlit application for handwriting-based learning-difficulty screening and adaptive learning support. The project combines multiple PyTorch image-classification models with interactive cognitive practice modules, child-safe feedback, and a parent/teacher dashboard for monitoring progress.

> **Important:** This project is a learning-support and research prototype. It is **not** a medical diagnostic tool and should not be used as the sole basis for diagnosing dyslexia or any learning disability. Results should be interpreted by qualified educators, clinicians, or specialists.

## Application Pages

The app uses Streamlit's multipage layout. Each file in `pages/` represents a major user-facing screen or activity.

| Page | File | Primary audience | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upload Handwriting Sample | `pages/1_Upload_Handwriting.py` | Child, Teacher/Parent | Upload a handwriting image, preview it, select a model, and start classification. |
| Classification Results | `pages/2_Classification_Result.py` | Teacher/Parent, supervised child use | Show the analyzed image, prediction result, probability distribution, recommendations, and prior classification history. |
| Learning Support | `pages/3_Learning_Support.py` | Child | Central activity hub with progress, game choices, success tips, recent games, and navigation to support modules. |
| Attention & Focus | `pages/4_Attention_Focus.py` | Child | Target-letter activity with configurable game time, grid size, target letter, results, and next-step navigation. |
| Visual Memory | `pages/5_Visual_Memory.py` | Child | Memory recall game with difficulty selection, timed visual prompts, answer choices, scoring, and follow-up navigation. |
| Auditory Memory | `pages/6_Auditory_Memory.py` | Child, Teacher/Parent | Sound-based memory activities with activity selection, difficulty settings, scoring, and teacher/parent notes. |
| Working Memory | `pages/7_Working_Memory.py` | Child, Teacher/Parent | Number memory game with mode selection, starting sequence length, adaptive play, and teacher/parent notes. |
| Processing Speed | `pages/8_Processing_Speed.py` | Child, Teacher/Parent | Quick-response activities with task selection, difficulty settings, reaction/accuracy tracking, and teacher/parent notes. |
| Final Assessment | `pages/9_Final_Assessment.py` | Child, Teacher/Parent | Combined assessment experience with timing, summary, performance feedback, and teacher/parent notes. |

### Page Flow

1. `app.py` shows the landing experience and lets users choose Child Mode or Teacher/Parent Mode.
2. Child Mode creates or selects a child profile, then routes the child toward handwriting upload and learning activities.
3. `pages/1_Upload_Handwriting.py` stores the uploaded handwriting image and selected model in session state.
4. `pages/2_Classification_Result.py` reads the stored upload/model choice, runs inference, records results, and shows recommendations.
5. `pages/3_Learning_Support.py` acts as the child-friendly activity hub after classification or direct navigation.
6. `pages/4_Attention_Focus.py`, `pages/5_Visual_Memory.py`, `pages/6_Auditory_Memory.py`, `pages/7_Working_Memory.py`, and `pages/8_Processing_Speed.py` provide focused practice modules.
7. `pages/9_Final_Assessment.py` provides a broader final assessment and summary for review.

### Page Design Notes

- **Child-facing pages** should use encouraging language, large controls, visual feedback, and avoid diagnostic labeling.
- **Teacher/parent sections** can include more detailed notes, but should still avoid presenting model output as a clinical diagnosis.
- **Navigation state** is managed through Streamlit session state helpers in `utils/session_manager.py`.
- **Scores and activity records** are persisted through `database/db_handler.py`.
- **Theme controls** are reused through `utils/theme.py`, so new pages should use the existing theme helper instead of duplicating styling logic.

## Requirements

### Runtime

- Python **3.8+** recommended.
- Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- A modern browser for the Streamlit interface.
- CPU is sufficient for local use; GPU is optional if your PyTorch installation supports it.

### Model Checkpoints

The app expects trained PyTorch checkpoints in the `models/` directory:

| Model | Required file |
| --- | --- |
| Custom CNN | `models/cnn_classifier (2).pth` |
| MobileNet V3 Large | `models/mobilenet_v3_large_classifier.pth` |
| EfficientNet-B0 | `models/efficientnet_b0_classifier (1).pth` |

If checkpoints are missing or incompatible, model loading/inference may fail. See `weights/README.md` for supported checkpoint formats and troubleshooting notes.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd learning-disabilities-ai-framework
```

If you already have the project locally, open a terminal in the project root.

### 2. Create a virtual environment

#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### macOS/Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Upgrade packaging tools

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Confirm model files

Verify that the required `.pth` files are present in `models/`.

```bash
ls models
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .\models
```

## Usage

### Start the application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Streamlit usually opens the app automatically. If it does not, visit:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

### Typical Child Mode workflow

1. Choose **Child Mode** from the landing screen.
2. Select an existing child profile or create a new one.
3. Open **Upload Handwriting Sample**.
4. Upload a handwriting image.
5. Choose a classification model.
6. Review child-safe feedback and recommendations.
7. Continue with support activities such as attention, visual memory, auditory memory, working memory, or processing speed.

### Typical Teacher/Parent workflow

1. Choose **Teacher / Parent** from the landing screen.
2. Log in with the admin credentials.
3. Select a child profile.
4. Review available progress, activity, stars, and classification history.
5. Use the insights to guide practice and follow-up support.

Default demo credentials:

```text
Username: admin
Password: Teacher@123
```

### Programmatic model check

You can quickly verify checkpoint availability from Python:

```python
from models.model_loader import ModelLoader

loader = ModelLoader()
print(loader.check_weights_available())
```

## Configuration and Customization

### Model behavior

Edit `models/model_loader.py` to customize:

- `CLASS_LABELS`
- CNN binary conversion behavior.
- Dyslexia probability threshold.
- MobileNet/EfficientNet class-index swapping.
- Checkpoint file paths.

### Model architectures

Edit these files if your trained checkpoints use different layer definitions:

- `models/cnn_model.py`
- `models/mobilenet_model.py`
- `models/efficientnet_model.py`

Keep architecture definitions aligned with the training code used to produce each checkpoint.

### Database

The local SQLite database lives at:

```text
database/learning_support.db
```

Use `database/db_handler.py` for schema and data-access changes. For a clean local demo reset, back up the database first, then replace or recreate it intentionally.

### Teacher/Parent admin login

Teacher/Parent Mode is protected by a simple admin login. By default, the app uses:

```text
Username: admin
Password: Teacher@123
```

To customize credentials without editing `app.py`, copy `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example` to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and change the values:

```toml
ADMIN_USERNAME = "admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your-new-password"
```

Do not commit a real `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file if it contains private credentials.

### UI and accessibility

Customize interface behavior in:

- `app.py` for the landing page, mode selection, dashboard, and shared styles.
- `pages/` for individual Streamlit screens.
- `utils/theme.py` for theme-related helpers.
- `utils/audio.py` and `utils/image_processing.py` for media helpers.

### Assets and diagrams

- `assets/README.md` describes model architecture diagrams.
- `SYSTEM_DESIGN_IMAGE_PROMPT.md` contains prompts for regenerating architecture visuals.
- `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_TABS.md` documents the app architecture in tab-oriented form.

## Testing and Validation

This repository currently does not include a dedicated automated test suite or test runner configuration.

Recommended validation steps:

### Syntax check

```bash
python -m py_compile app.py models/*.py pages/*.py database/*.py utils/*.py
```

On Windows PowerShell, if wildcard behavior causes issues:

```powershell
python -m py_compile app.py
python -m py_compile (Get-ChildItem models,pages,database,utils -Filter *.py -Recurse).FullName
```

### Streamlit smoke test

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then verify:

- The landing screen loads.
- Child Mode allows profile creation or selection.
- Teacher/Parent Mode loads the dashboard.
- Handwriting upload accepts an image.
- Each configured model either loads successfully or reports a clear missing/incompatible-checkpoint error.
- Support modules open without crashing.

### Model checkpoint check

```python
from models.model_loader import ModelLoader

loader = ModelLoader()
availability = loader.check_weights_available()
assert all(availability.values()), availability
```

### Pull request checklist

- [ ] The app starts with `streamlit run app.py`.
- [ ] Updated or added documentation where needed.
- [ ] UI changes remain accessible and child-safe.
- [ ] Model changes document checkpoint compatibility.
- [ ] Database changes include migration/reset notes if relevant.

## Known Limitations

- **Not a diagnosis:** the system supports screening and practice, but it does not replace professional assessment.
- **Transformation sensitivity:** models may classify real handwriting correctly while misclassifying reversed or transformed versions of similar letters. Improving transformed-input performance can reduce normal-input performance.
- **Visual-cue dependence:** current models may rely on orientation, stroke direction, and pixel layout instead of robust transformation-invariant dyslexia indicators.
- **Local database:** data is stored locally in SQLite and is not configured for multi-user production deployment.
- **No formal automated test suite:** validation currently relies on syntax checks, smoke tests, and manual UI/model verification.
